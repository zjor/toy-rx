Toy Rx
======

This is a simplified implementation of Rx principles.
The main emphasis is made to implement change propagation to modified streams.

The implementation is not optimal and may suffer from memory leaks.

The goal of this project is to learn how Rx library works internally.

TODO
====

 - implement proper stream completion to wait for timed streams to terminate
 - implement buffer
 - implement simple UI app converting stream of clicks into stream of double clicks, long-clicks
 - make an Applet from SpreadSheetApp, host jar somewhere & embed here
